# Project Name: Card Deck and Utility for Managing It.

## Description
This project is a Go programming language-based program that allows you to create and manage a deck of cards. The core of the project consists of a 54-card deck, including standard suits and jokers. The program offers the following functionality:

- **Deck Creation:** Create a new deck that includes standard suits (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs) and two jokers (Colorful and Black and White).

- **Deck Shuffling:** Thoroughly shuffle the deck to ensure randomness of the cards.

- **Card Dealing:** Deal a specified number of cards from the deck. For example, you can deal 6 random cards.

- **Deck Saving:** Save the generated or dealt deck on your computer in a text file for later use.

- **Deck Loading:** Load a saved deck from a file and continue working with it.

The project includes functions for creating, shuffling, dealing, saving, and loading decks, providing a simple and user-friendly interface for card management.
